<h2>Pointer!</h2>
<p>Welcome to Pointer Intergalactic Trade. Your task is to travel between planets and buy and sell stock so that when you arrive at the drop off zone you have the highlighted amount of stock. Your current stock level is indicated by a dot: in the screenshot below, your stock level is +1. Your task is to bring it to +2 by trading with different planets.</p>

<p>There are different types of planets. Each type of planet changes your stock level in a different way. Pay attention to how your stock levels change as you visit the different types planets so you can pick the route to the drop off zone which will allow you to reach the highlighted stock level at the drop off zone.</p>

<p>The drop off zone will only allow you to land if you have the correct stock level; it will turn yellow if you are allowed to land. If you don't have the correct stock level, the drop off zone will stay gray, you will not be able to land. If this happens, you can click skip round. This will take you to the next round.</p>
<p>You will complete 95 rounds during the game. This will take you a total of 30 to 60 minutes to complete. Each round will feature a different planetary system and each planetary system contains different paths between planets. Click on the planet images to navigate between them.</p>
<p>The game has two phases: a training phase (Phase 1, 48 rounds) where you can learn about the different planets and how they affect your stock levels, and a test phase (Phase 2, 47 rounds), where we will assess how well you have learnt the game. <b> Your performance during the second phase will determine your bonus </b>. Your bonus will be proportional to the number of game rounds you solve in the second phase. The bonus will be up to a maximum of &#163;4.</p>
<p>The game must have your full attention and be played in fullscreen mode. <b> Leaving fullscreen will immediately cancel the game and your participation in the study </b>.</p>
<p>It is recommended to find a quiet place with a good internet connection and turn off your notifications.</p>
