        <p>Welcome to Roomworld!</p> <br>
        <br>
        <p>Play 92 short rounds. This will take you a total of 30 to 60 minutes to complete.</p><br>
        <br>
        <p>Each round is a set of rooms on a different floor. You are challenged to move through the rooms to get to the gift. Every fifth round will be a Challenge Round, more difficult than the ones before.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Use the arrow keys &#10145; &#11015; &#11014; &#11013; on your screen to navigate the space. <br></p>
        <br>
        <p>If you're unsure how to solve a round, you have two options: </p><br>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>You can try to solve the round again. To do this, press <b>restart round</b>. This will restart the same round. You can do this up to three times on a regular round, but can't do it on a Challenge Round. <br></li>
            <li>You can also give up and skip to the next round. To do this, click <b>skip round</b>. This will take you to the next round. <br></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Your first time playing is what counts, so make sure to give it your full attention. Closing the browser and relaunching the game will resume your progress.</p><br>
        <br>
        Tips:
        <ul>
            <li>Find a quiet place with a good internet connection and turn off your notifications.</li>
            <li>If you find that your connection isn't good enough, you can stop playing and come back later</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br> 
        <p>If you find in the first couple of rounds that your connection isn't good enough, you can stop playing and come back later.</p><br>
