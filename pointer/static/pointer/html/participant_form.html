<h2>PARTICIPANT FORM - Pointer</h2>
<p>Before running the task, we will require you to read, understand and agree with a consent form, read carefully the guidelines describing what you will have to do.</p>
<p>Additionally, we need to ask you to focus exclusively on the task you are about to do. This is very important - so please close all "chat" applications, games, etc. At any time before you get your verification code, <b>if you leave the window, the task may be cancelled!</b></p>
<p>If the task is cancelled or you run into any technical issues, contact us at hiplab@psy.ox.ac.uk and <b>do not restart the task</b>. This is important because it's a learning experiment, and restarting the experiment may affect its outcome.</p>
<p>In general, if you have any issues or questions, please put yourself in contact with hiplab@psy.ox.ac.uk and let us know what happened. Don't forget to specify the task you are running (see the title of this website).</p>
<!-- <p>We would like to ask you some details about yourself.  We will not record anything about you that can identify you.  This is just so we can see whether there are any trends within the data.</p>
